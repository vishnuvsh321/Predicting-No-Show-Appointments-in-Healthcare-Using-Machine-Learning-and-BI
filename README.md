# Predicting No-Show Appointments in Healthcare Using Machine Learning and BI

This project explores a real-world dataset of medical appointments in Brazil to predict and understand patient no-shows. It combines data preprocessing, machine learning classification models, and business intelligence (BI) visualizations to deliver actionable insights for improving appointment adherence in healthcare settings.

## üîç Problem Statement

Missed medical appointments cost healthcare systems time, resources, and money. By identifying patterns in patient demographics, health conditions, and scheduling practices, we aim to predict which patients are likely to miss appointments and explore what interventions could reduce no-show rates.

## üìä Key Findings from Visualization

- **No-show Rate by SMS**: SMS reminders had little impact.
- **Age**: Young adults (18‚Äì34) are more likely to miss appointments.
- **Weekday**: Mondays saw the highest no-show rate.
- **Scheduling Delay**: Longer delays increased no-show probability.
- **Socioeconomic Status**: Scholarship recipients had higher no-show rates.
- **Chronic Conditions**: Hypertension and diabetes correlated with better attendance.
- **Alcoholism**: Associated with higher no-show rates.

(See `summary_of_visualizations.pdf` for detailed insights.)
